This was a media campaign proposal I wrote as part of a Media Theory course in the Summer of 2020.  The idea behind it was to positively influence college students to adopt better hygiene habits as outlined by the CDC in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The idea was that by showing students images and videos of their peers casually adhering to healthier habits, they would more likely adopt the habits themselves.
