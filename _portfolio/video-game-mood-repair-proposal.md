title: "Video Game & Mood Repair Proposal"
excerpt: "This proposal aims to cement published research on the effect of computer game difficulty on noxious moods by establishing a backing in the The Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP).  The purpose of this study is to further establish a link between people in noxious mood states and the difficulty of video games.  Participants will be chosen randomly to be put through either a boredom/control condition or through a mood manipulation designed to put them into a negatively valenced mood.  While the participants are connected to psychophysiological measurement tools, they will play a computer game at a randomly assigned difficulty of either boredom/easy, hard, or flow.  The results of the study should show similar results to that of previous research on video games and mood repair, a curvilinear relationship where mood repair increases with difficulty to a point then diminishes once the task is too difficult (Bowman & Tamborini, 2012)."

This was a proposal I wrote as part of a Research Methods course in the fall of 2019.  The idea behind it being that there is self-report evidence in the communications literature that supports the idea of more cognitively demanding tasks resulting in an increase in mood repair.  My proposal was to use an updated and more specialized stimuli for the cognitively demanding task, and document whether that increase in mood repair was reflected through psychophysiological measurements.
