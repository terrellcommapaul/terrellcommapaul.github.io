This is my first post for this static website project.

At this time I am working as an IT Support Specialist II and working through a Masters in Mass Communication, both with the College of Media & Communication at Texas Tech University.

I am in the process of working on and/or setting up the website for the Cognition and Emotion Lab, run by Dr. Keene.

For the purposes of learning Ruby, Jekyll, and Git, I am working through the setup of this website. I will end up with a portfolio/publications online presence at the end so this is a two birds one stone situation.

If you are reading this, do not expect much from this website.
